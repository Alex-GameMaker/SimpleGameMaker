Dear game developers!

The Simple Game Maker game engine is designed for projects in three-dimensional (3D) and 2D space.

Both the engine itself and the projects created with it are designed for Windows PCs for 32-bit systems.
(Please do not ask about Android, the development team is not planning to develop for this platform in the coming months).

What programming language is used for development? FreeBASIC, in accordance with the philosophy of the engine (see point 5).
3) Who is it intended for? For amateurs, hobbyists, enthusiasts who make game projects for entertainment, in their free time
from work or study.
If you want to make a game with the highest level of graphics, a game of the so-called AAA class or level, then perhaps you
should pay attention to other engines with which different teams and development studios make such games.

4) Is it possible to make a high-quality game with Simple Game Maker? Absolutely! The fact that the engine is designed for
   amateurs, does not mean that you can't make a good game with it.  You can make a pretty high-quality game on it, unless
   it's critical for you that the game should have the latest graphics (special effects etc) with super-realistic characters
   or environments. (If you need supergraphics, most likely you have already found your engine and are happy to work in a studio
   with a budget of $ 1000000).

6) The main idea of the engine: to simplify the creation of amateur games (for PC Windows) to such an extent that even amateurs
   who do not have much experience in programming can do something, turn their idea or dream into a REAL GAME project, which
   otherwise they would most likely not be able to do, trying to make a game with an engine or a programming language, which they
   would have to spend on a lot of time mastering it.

9) The main features of the engine. Graphics core: Irrlicht 1.9.0. OpenGL; 1.2-4.x, DirectX 9.0c, networking, Newton physics.

10) Advantages of the engine:
- fast, even on older machines FPS is quite high. This is achieved thanks to the Irrlicht graphics core and several optimization features; 
- For beginners: a simple and intuitive programming language is used - FreeBASIC.
- The engine is free and you decide under which license to distribute the games made with it;
- the functions of the engine are completely understandable;
- more than 120 examples, 3 templates and about 20 open source projects;
- a friendly community ready to help.
8) Disadvantages:
- there is no the engine's own scene editor yet, a third-party one is used, which is not very convenient; but in some cases, when there are
  not so many objects on the scene, you can do without an editor at all.
